# Nalu Wind Energy Utilities

![Docs status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/naluwindutils/badge/)

This is a companion software library to
[Nalu-Wind](http://nalu-wind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) a generalized,
unstructured, massively parallel, incompressible flow solver for wind turbine
and wind farm simulations. As the name indicates, this software repository
provides various meshing, pre- and post-processing utilities for use with the
Nalu CFD code to aid setup and analysis of wind energy LES problems. This
